    <p>I'm broadly interested in understanding the human ability to communicate – in particular, how we learn from others and teach others. My research brings together various approaches, aiming to provide a unified description of the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie the representations and inferential processes that allow us to learn and share about the world. As the PI of the Social Learning Lab, I'm thrilled to explore these questions with  amazing people who all love to "learn from one another”!

In addition, I am interested in questions related to future-thinking: how might considerations of cost (including our estimations of time) influence our ability to make plans into the future?

I am fascinated by how we form, maintain, and update representations of the self through observations and social interactions, and I am particularly interested in the developmental roots of these processes. My work is broadly centered around how young children learn about the self through interactions with others and how they strategically communicate about the self to others.</p>

How might the presence of another mind affect the hypotheses a learner considers? Do the socio-dynamics of the environment impact a learner’s representation of the cost of information sharing? How, when, and why do children choose to teach others? </p>

    <p>Humans are efficient and adaptable learners, but we don't have to learn everything from scratch – some tasks, such as learning to drive a car or finding foods that are safe to eat, would be difficult, even dangerous, to do without gathering information from other people. My research explores how children and adults exploit the rich structure of the social world to decide when to learn from others and whom to learn from. I also designed this website!</p>

    <p>When I started my master's in computer science, the future of AI and determining its place among humans was the focus of my research. I tried to address the issue with a philosophical point of view, but I realized I needed to better understand human intelligence first. After spending the rest of the program working on MVPA analysis of fear and anxiety, I now study Theory of Mind at the SLL. Specifically, I'm interested in the neural correlates of ToM when thinking about beliefs of the self versus other.

My current research interests include studying how people learn about and utilize information about others' preferences and the psychological processes involved in forming social bonds. Unlike many of my peers in the lab, I study primarily adults (due to a more-than-mild fear of children). Other non-psychological research interests include determining the location of the best chai latte on campus and searching for my lost keys.

Working with children, I'm fascinated by their perpetual sense of wonder; as we grow up, we seem to lose that excitement about the world. I'm also interested in studying when children learn to be embarrassed and when/how the shift occurs from total freedom of expression (especially with things like joy) to understanding and following social rules.<br>

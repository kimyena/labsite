<h3>Joining Our Lab</h3>
      
    <h4> Undergraduate Research Assistant</h4>
  <p> Our lab welcomes enthusiastic, motivated undergraduate students to work during the school year and summer! Research assistants are involved in developing and making materials for studies, subject recruitment, and running experiments with children and adults. Some assistants may aid with fMRI scans (separate training required). Minimal commitment is 8-10 hours/week for at least two quarters and preferably longer. Candidate also must be comfortable recruiting families at public settings and interacting with them. Previous research experience and/or working with children are not necessary but preferable. Proficiency with MATLAB, R, and working with video editing software is also desirable. </p>

<br>    
  <p> To apply, please contact Grace Bennett-Pierre (lab manager) at <a href="mailto:sll.stanford@gmail.com">sll.stanford [at] gmail.com</a> with your résumé. </p>

<!-- <h2> Lab Manager Position </h2>

    <h2> Part-time Paid Research Assistant </h2>
  <p> We are looking for a part-time (15-20 hours/week) research assistant to begin ASAP. This RA will mainly be involved in subject recruitment and running experiments with young children. Previous experience working with children in a lab setting is highly desirable; proficiency with MATLAB, R, as well as working with video editing software is also helpful. </p>


   <p> The Social Learning Lab (SLL) welcomes enthusiastic, motivated individuals to apply for a lab manager position to start in summer 2016.  This person will work closely with other lab members to assist in all aspects of running the lab and conducting research. </p>

      <p> The goal of our research is to understand the cognitive underpinnings of our ability to communicate with others to both learn about and teach others about both the physical and the social world. To this end, we employ a variety of methods: many of our projects involve behavioral methods with young children, fMRI experiments with adults and children, as well as online experiments with adults.  A successful candidate would be someone who would feel comfortable being involved in all aspects of research as well as taking good care of general lab business (e.g., training & coordinating undergraduate research assistants, recruiting & running subjects, communicating with staff at our research sites, constructing stimuli, managing & analyzing data, etc.). This person will also have opportunities to develop independent research projects.</p>

<p>A BA or BS degree in Psychology, Cognitive Science, Computer Science, or in related fields would be helpful but not required. Research experience (particularly in cognitive neuroscience or cognitive development), strong statistical background, and programming skills (e.g., MATLAB) is highly desirable. </p>

<p>This position will be posted as a one-year position. Ideally however the position will start in summer 2016 and would be held for two years. Renewal will be contingent upon performance. We ask all applicants to submit their answers to questions as part of the application. For best consideration, please apply by February 1, 2016. </p>

<h2> Stanford CSLI Summer Internship Program 2016</h2>

<p>Join us at Stanford for an interdisciplinary summer research experience program in the cognitive sciences! </p>

<p> At the Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), interns will work closely with a faculty, postdoc, or grad student mentor on an original cognitive science research project. They will gain experience developing the project, collecting data, and analyzing the results. In addition to their individual projects, interns will attend weekly mentorship meetings and seminars with such topics as reading a scientific paper, introduction to data analysis, statistics and visualization, and presentation skills. The program will culminate with each intern presenting their work to an interdisciplinary audience.

The topical focus of the program will be on language, learning, computation, and cognition, with an emphasis on giving students the skills they need to complete an independent project. Mentors will be from cognitive science departments across Stanford, including Psychology, Linguistics, Computer Science, and Philosophy.

<p> The program is 8 weeks, from 6/20/15 - 8/12/15, and is primarily intended for rising college Juniors and Seniors, though we will consider other applicants as well. Applications are due by midnight on Sunday, February 28th, 2015. We encourage applications from students without prior research experience and from non-research institutions. Accepted students will receive a stipend sufficient to cover travel, room, and board. For more information and an application form, see http://www-csli.stanford.edu/csli-summer-internship-program-2016. </p> -->
